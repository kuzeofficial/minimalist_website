# What is Docker?

Docker is a tool designed to facilitate the creation, deployment and execution of applications, and it does all of this using containers.
Containers allow the developer to package their application including the code they wrote, its dependencies, and send it as a package.
With containers, you can not only be sure that your application will work in whatever environment it is deployed, but you will also have the reproducibility to ensure that it works consistently.

# Docker installation

The first thing we must do is install it, for this we will go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and we will download it depending on our operating system

# Dockerfile creation

First we make sure that we have docker installed with the following command:

```shell
  docker -v
```

After this we are going to create a Dockerfile which will contain the following configuration

```docker
# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM node:14-alpine AS deps
# Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM node:14-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN yarn build

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM node:14-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# You only need to copy next.config.js if you are NOT using the default configuration
# COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT 3000

# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
# Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

CMD ["node_modules/.bin/next", "start"]
```

# Dockerignore

We can also create a '.dockerignore' file which will include files or folders that will not be included in the image build.

```docker
  Dockerfile
  .dockerignore
  node_modules
  npm-debug.log
  README.md
  .next
```

# Building the Docker image

```shell
  docker build . -t nextjs-name-image
```

# List Docker Images

To see the docker images that we have created and saved locally, we do it with the following command

```shell
  docker images
```

# Initialize Next.js locally with Docker

To start Next.js locally with docker we use the following command

```shell
  docker run -e PORT=3000 nextjs-name-image
```

To configure the Google Cloud SDK, the first thing you have to do is download it for your operating system [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

> 💡 This installation takes a while

After having the executable installed, what you are going to do is confirm that it was installed correctly by executing this command in the console

```shell
  gcloud -v
```

Then we are going to go to the google cloud console and we are going to create a new project

[Console Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=famous-empire-334921)

After seeing this new project created we have to authenticate in the Google Cloud SDK using the following command

```shell
  gcloud auth login
```

Then we select the account to start the section and everything is ok

# Building the image with Google Cloud Build

To build the image we use the following command

```bash
  gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<DockerNextJS>/<helloworld> --project DockerNextJS
```

`<>` : This is the name of the project you created in the google cloud console

# Deploying the image to Google Cloud Run

To deploy google cloud run we execute the following command:

```shell
  gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<DockerNextJS>/<helloworld> --project DockerNextJS --platform managed
```
